# RPI-services

## Three services required:
* hella service [see hella project]
* modem service [see modem project]
* ups service - https://wiki.geekworm.com/X1201 - Download the software, and modify the bat.py file as seen in this repo. I think I had to fix a scope error in one of the other geekwork files - which wasn't that hard.
